STRUCTURE

1. Sub-problems:
        given a number of eggs and
        certain number of floors to be tested
        tell me how many moves do I require to
        know about all possible critical floors

2. Guesses:
        I have k floor in front of me.
        Let me drop my first egg at ith floor
        Now, two things can happen
        a) My egg will break : critical floor can be that floor or a floor below it
        b) My egg wil not break : critical floor is for sure above it

        Try all the possibilities

3. Relating Sub-problems:

        dp(n, k) = min[max(dp(n-1, x-1) , dp(n, k-x)) + 1] for all x in floors

        Base Case:
            dp(n, 0) = 0   // I have 0 floors to test, that can be done in 0 moves
            dp(0, k) = not possible  // I don't have any eggs but I have some
                                     // floors to test. Clearly, that is not possible



4. Answering the original problem:
        return dp(N, K)

CODE:

    public:
    int inf = 10000000;
    //Function to find minimum number of attempts needed in
    //order to find the critical floor.
    int eggDrop(int n, int k)
    {
        // your code here
        vector<vector<int>> dp(n+1, vector<int> (k+1, inf));
        for(int i=0;i<=n;i++) dp[i][0] = 0;
        for(int i=1;i<=k;i++) dp[0][i] = inf;

        for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
            for(int j=1;j<=k;j++){
                int res = inf;
                for(int x=1;x<=j;x++)
                    res = min(res, 1+max(dp[i-1][x-1], dp[i][j-x]));
                dp[i][j] = res;
            }
        }

        return dp[n][k];
    }
