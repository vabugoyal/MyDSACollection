STRUCTURE

Sub-Problems:
        given an array of matrices to be multiplied together
        starting from index i and ending at index j. Tell me the
        minimum possible operations required to multiply those
        matrices together.
Guesses:
        Since, the matrices are to be multiplied together, so
        there will be some multiplication which I will be doing at last.
        I will make guesses about that operation.
Expressions:
        for x = i+1 to j
            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][x-1] + ls[i]*ls[x]*ls[j+1] + dp[x][j])

        Base Cases:
        dp[i][j] = 0 for all i >= j


Answering the original Problem:
        return dp[0][n-2]


CODE:

    int MatrixChainOrder(int* ls, int n)
    {

    	vector<vector<int>> dp(n, vector<int> (n, 0));

    	for (int i=n-2;i>=0;--i) {
    	    for (int j=i+1;j<n;j++) {
    	        dp[i][j] = INT32_MAX;
    	        for (int x=i+1;x<=j;x++) {
    	            dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][x-1] + ls[i]*ls[x]*ls[j+1] + dp[x][j]);
    	        }
    	    }
    	}

    	return dp[0][n-2];



    }
