STRUCTURE

Sub-Problems:
        given an array starting from index i,
        tell me the length of the longest increasing (strictly)
        sub-sequence
Guesses:
        a) ith element is a part of a sub-sequence
        b) ith element is not a part of a sub-sequence
Expressions:
        dp[i] = dp[i+1]
        for x = i+1 to n-1
            if (ls[x] > ls[i]) {
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + dp[x])
            }

        Base Cases
        dp[n] = 0

        Time Complexity: O(n^2)
