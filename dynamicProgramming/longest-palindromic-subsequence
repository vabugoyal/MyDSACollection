STRUCTURE

Sub-Problems:
        given a string starting from index i
        and ending at index j, find the longest
        palindromic subsequence in it
Guesses:
        Guesses will be made about the characters at index i and j
Expressions:

        if (s[i] == s[j]) {
            dp[i][j] = 2 + dp[i+1][j+1]
        } else {
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])
        }

        Base Cases:
        if (i > j) dp[i][j] = 0
        if (i == j) dp[i][j] = 1

Answering the original Problem:
        return max(dp[i][j]) for all i, j
