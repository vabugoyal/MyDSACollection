STRUCTURE

Sub-Problems:
        given a tree rooted at index x, tell me
        the largest independent set in it.
Guesses:
        I will make guesses about the root of the tree
        a) root will be a part of largest independent set
        b) root will not be a part of largest independent set
Expressions:
        I root is a part of largest then its child can't be
        possibility1 = 1 + dp[child of child], sum over all child of child
        possibility2 = dp[child] , sum over all child

        dp[i] = max(possibility1, possibility2)

Answering the original Problem:
        return dp[root]
