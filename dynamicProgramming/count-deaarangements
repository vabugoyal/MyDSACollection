STRUCTURE:

1. Sub-Problems:
        Given a number of elements n,
        find the number of ways to de-arrange them
2. Guesses:
        Guesses will be made about the first element.
        First element can be at (n-1) positions.

        Let's say that I put it at kth position. Now,
        the element at kth position has two choices either
        it will be placed at 1st position in return or it
        will be placed somewhere else.

        dp[n] = (n-1)[dp[n-2] + dp[n-1]]
        dp[n-2] for the case when it is placed at zero in return
        dp[n-1] for the case when it is placed somewhere else

        How dp[n-1] is valid ?
        Consider Me putting kth element at the first position.
        Now, I don't want it to be at that position. So, I can
        consider that it is placed at right position.
        Basically ans is de-arrangement of (n-1) elements.
