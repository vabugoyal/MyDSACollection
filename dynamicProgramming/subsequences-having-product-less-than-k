STRUCTURE

Sub-Problems:
        given an array starting form index i, tell
        me the number of sub-sequences having product less
        than j
Guesses:
        a) ith element is a part of a sub-sequence
        b) ith element is not a part of a sub-sequence
Expressions:
        dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j] + [ dp[i+1][(j+ls[i]-1)/ls[i]] + (j > ls[i]) ]

        Base Cases
        dp[n][0] = 0 for all j

Answering the original problem:

        return dp[0][k]
