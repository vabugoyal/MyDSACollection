STRUCTURE

Sub-Problems:
        given an array starting from index i,
        tell me the maximum sum which I can get given
        I cannot choose three consecutive elements
Guesses:
        a) ith element is not included
        b) ith element is included
            i)   ith and (i+1)th elements are consecutive
            ii)  ith and (i+1)th elements are not consecutive
Expressions:

        dp[i] = max(ls[i]+ls[i+1]+dp[i+3], ls[i] + dp[i+2], dp[i+1])

        Base Cases:
        dp[n] = 0
        dp[n+1] = 0
        dp[n+2] = 0
Answering the original problem:
        return dp[0]
