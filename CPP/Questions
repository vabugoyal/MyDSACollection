------------------------------------------COMPILATION------------------------------------------
How compilation works?
    Initially we have header files(.h) and cpp files(.cpp).
    The compilation process converts these to independent
    object files.
    Compilation consists of three parts:
    1. Preprocessor(.i): replace macros, replace the content of header
    files with the actual code, remove the comments, etc.
    2. Compiler(.s): convert to assembly code
    3. Assembler(.o): convert to machine code

    Linker which links all the object file and convert
    them into an executable(.exe). If definition of some symbol is
    missing in obj files then we have to provide static libraries
    during compilation.

    If I get error of undefined reference then it means that something wrong
    if going on in the linker.

    Loader will load the executable into the operating system.



Preprocessing:

    Including a header file two time will not work because that will
    give two definitions of the same function.
    to handle this we can use something like this in hpp file where
    declaration of the function are given

    #ifndef SOURCE_HPP // if not defined source.hpp then define it otherwise not
    #define SOURCE_HPP
    int add(int a, int b);
    #endif


    Commands:
    ./ to run executable
    g++ -E main.cpp | to run the program through preprocessor stage
    g++ main.cpp -o prog | to give default name to executable as prog


Compiler and assembly:
    Commands:
    g++ -c main.cpp will make a obj file(.o) i.e main.o
    g++ main.o source.o -o prog // this will like the two ojbect files into a single program called prog











Difference between reference and pointer?
1. If we create a reference it will have the same memory address as that of the variable.
   Pointer has its own address and may change the address of the variable it is pointing to.
   Reference is like a constant pointer with automatic indirection i.e compiler will apply *
   operator for you.
2. Reference can't have NULL values.
3. References does not store arithmetic operations.
4. References does not have indirection.








Function Pointers in C








Use of friend function?
1. For testing purpose
2. To explicitly give rights to someone outside the class.










Difference between plain enum and enum class

symbols in plain enum has global scope which
means you can't redeclare those as new symbols or variables.
enum symbols get converted into integer which creates a
problem
enum Color{red, green , blue}
            0     1       2
enum People{good, bad}
              0    1
implies that red == good
but symbols in enum class are not integers

Best place to use enum: when we are dealing with limited set of values.







Big Endian: MSB at lowest address
Little Endian: LSB  at lowest address

Check if system is little endian or big endian?
int main() {
    unsigned int x = 1;
    char *c = (char *)&x;
    if (*c & 1) {
        cout << "Little Endian" << endl;
    } else {
        cout << "Big Endian" << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}











How to stop someone from taking address of your object?

& operator is automatically overloaded by compiler in cpp
1. You can overload the operator in the class and make it private.
2. You can delete the operator from the class
class Base {
    int x;
    Base * operator & () {
        return this;
    }
    or
    Base * operator & () = delete;
}


How to prevent someone from copying your objects?
1. Keep copy constructor and assignment operator as private in your class.
        class Base {
        public:
            int _x;
            Base(){}
            Base(int x) : _x{x} {}
        private:
            Base(Base &rhs) : _x{rhs._x} {}
            void operator = (const Base& rhs) {_x = rhs._x;}

        };

2. Inherit dummy class with private copy constructor and assignment operator
        class StopCopy {
        public:
            StopCopy() {}
            StopCopy(StopCopy &stp) {}
            void operator = (const StopCopy& rhs) {};
        private:
        };

        class Base : public StopCopy {
        public:
            int _x;
            Base() {}
            Base(int x) : _x{x} {}
        };

3. Delete copy constructor and assignment operator from your class
        class Base {
            int _x;
        public:
            Base() {}
            Base(int x) : _x{x} {}
            Base(const Base & bs) = delete;
            void operator = (const Base &rhs) = delete;
        };





Void and void pointer
1. only void means nothing
2. Void * means pointer to anything (except function pointer, const, volatile)
3. Malloc and calloc returns a void so we can typecast them into anything
4. use to create generic function in cpp like cmp function in c (cmp take two void pointers as arguments)
cannot use these pointers to dereference some address in memory
arithmetic operations are not possible on them






Constant Cast const_cast<int*>(some pointer which is a constant)
    If we have a constant pointer then it will be a read only pointer
    which mean we can't change the value at the memory it is pointing to.

    We should use it only when actual referred obj is not constant otherwise it will cause undefined behaviour.
    Used when using external lib or api and it want the data in non constant form.


Reinterpret Cast reinterpret_cast<int*>(some string pointer)
    it can perform dangerous conversions as it can typecast any
    pointer to any other pointer. It is used to work with bits.

    if we use this type of cast then it becomes a non portable cast.


Static Cast
    it performs conversion between types
    Q. why use static cast when implicit conversion is involved?
    Ans Easier to find all the conversions where static cast is involved.

    used when conversion is provided through conversion constructor and
    conversion operator.

    static cast is more restrictive than C-style
    C-style :int * p  = (char *) c;
    this is a dangerous conversion and won't be allowed with static cast

    static cast avoid cast from derived to private base pointer

    use for all up casts but not for down casts
    upcast: base class pointer is pointing to a derived class
            object slicing happens when a derived class object is
            assigned to a base class object i.e we can only access
            base class members or virtual function using the base class
            pointer.

    now say we have two derived classes D1 and D2 and we type cast
    D1 to B and then down cast B to D2 which is bad so we use dynamic cast for
    that.


Dynamic Cast:
    works only on polymorphic base class (at least one virtual function)
    because it uses this information about wrong down cast











Returning an array from a function

static keyword: whenever we create anything with static keyword
                then that memory is not getting destroyed until your
                whole program gets completed.
CODE:
        int * func() {
            const int n = 3;
            static int arr[n];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
                arr[i] = i + 1;
            }
            return arr;
        }


        int main() {
            int *arr = func();
            cout << arr[1] << endl;
            return 0;
        }


Returning a 2D array from a function
1. using a dynamic array using new operator
2. using static keyword
3. using struct







When do we use initializer list?

1. You cannot initialise non static constant data members without initializer list.
        class Base {
            const int _x;
        public:
            Base() : _x{0}  {};
            Base(int x) : _x{x} {};

        };


2. You cannot initialize reference variable without using initializer list.
        class Base {
            int &_x;
        public:
            Base(int &x) : _x{x} {};
        };

3. You cannot initialise 'some' class object insider another class if
   the 'some' class object is not having a zero parameter constructor.
       class One {
           int _x;
       public:
           One(int x): _x{x} {};
       };

       class Two {
           One a;
       public:
           Two(One x): a{x} {};
       };

4. Calling the base class constructor form the child class
        class Base {
            int _x;
        public:
            Base(int x) : _x{x} {};
        };

        class Child : public Base {
            int _y;
        public:
            Child(int x, int y): Base{x}, _y{y} {};
        };

5. Using initializer list to initialise the data will optimise the code.







How comma operator works?
It works from left to right.
int main() {
    int v1, v2;
    v1 = 1, 2, 3; // v1 = 1
    v2 = (1, 2, 3); // v2 = 3

    return 0;
}








Constructor Delegation : using other parameterised constructor to make curr constructor
class Base {
    int _x, _y;
public:
    Base() : Base(0, 0) {};
    Base(int a) : Base(a, 0) {};
    Base(int a, int b) {
        _x = a; _y = b;
    };
};






Code Bloating:
Code bloat is the production of code that is perceived as unnecessarily long, slow, or
otherwise waste of resources.
- declaring variables which are not even required
- Giving two statements which could be merged to one.










Diamond Problem in c++

      A
    /   \
   B     C
    \   /
      D

B is inheriting from A
C is inheriting from A
D is inheriting from D

so, the variables which were in A class will be
initialized twice through B and C

    class A{ public: int _a;};
    class B : virtual public A{ public: int _b;};
    class C : virtual public A{ public: int _c;};
    class D : public B, public C{ public: int _d;};


    int main() {
        D d;
        d._b = 10;
        d._c = 10;
        d._d = 10;
        d._a = 10;

        return 0;
    }










Static and Dynamic BindingBinding in cpp

Static Binding: if function calling is known at compile time
Dynamic Binding: if function calling is known at runtime time

class Base {
public:
    int _B;
    virtual void func() {cout << "Base class function is called." << endl;}
};

class Derived: public Base {
public:
    int _d;
    void func() {cout << "Derived class function is called" << endl;}
};

void muFunc(Base *b) {
    b->func();
}

int main() {
    muFunc(new Base);
    muFunc(new Derived);
    return 0;
}

At compile time this will bind func to base class func.
But that will be bind to derived class func when derived class
pointer is passed. (Dynamic binding)






Difference between range for loop and for_each in cpp?

In for_each we can start from whatever index we want but not in for.
In for_each we can pass a function to do something with the value.

void func(int x) {
    cout << x << endl;
}

int main() {
    int ar[10];
    for (int i=0;i<10;i++) ar[i] = i;
    for (auto x : ar) {
        cout << x << endl;
    }
    for_each(ar, ar + 10, [](int x) {
       cout << x << endl;
    });

    for_each(ar, ar + 10, func);

    return 0;
}










How cpp obtains function overloading?

NAME MANGLING : cpp compiler changes the names of all functions to achieve function overloading.







What is auto keyword in cpp?
It is used for type deduction.







Why we must return reference in copy assignment?
To support channing assignment.
a = b = c = d






Virtual Destructor
When we delete a child class object using a pointer of
parent class then we have to define the constructor of
the base class as virtual otherwise the destructor
of virtual class will not be called and it may lead to memory
leak.


Virtual Constructor
The virtual pointer is pointed to vtable in the constructor.
If I make constructor as virtual then I won't be able to
point vptr to the constructor pointer.





Function pointer and call-backs
if a reference of a function is passed to another
function as an argument to call it then we call
it a call-back function.
