Approach:
    We know sum of a and b is
    s = a ^ b + 2 * (a & b)
    This can be defined recursively.
    sum(a, b) :
        if b == 0 : a
        else : sum(a^b, (a&b)<<1)

CODE:
    class Solution {
    public:
        int getSum(int a, int b) {
            while(b!=0) {
                int c = ((unsigned int)(a&b))<<1;
                a = a^b;
                b = c;
            }
            return a;
        }
    };
