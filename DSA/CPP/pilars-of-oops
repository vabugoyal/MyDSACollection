Encapsulation(Data Hiding):
Abstraction(Implementation Hiding):

Inheritance:
    Types:
        1. Single
        2. Multi-level
        3. Multiple
        4. Hybrid
        5. Hierarchical


Polymorphism:
    Compile-Time:
        function
        operator
    Run-Time
        function overriding in inheritance


Difference between Abstraction and Encapsulation
Abstraction:
    Hiding implementation using abstract class
    or interface. It happens at design level.
Encapsulation:
    It is a mechanism which binds together the code
    and data it manipulates and keeps both safe from
    outside interface and misuse. Hiding information
    from the user using getters and setters. This can
    be achieved using access modifiers.
