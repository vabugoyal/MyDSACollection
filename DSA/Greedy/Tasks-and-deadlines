Problem:
        We are given n tasks with durations and deadlines
        and our task is to choose and order to perform tasks.
        For each task we earn d-x points where d is the deadline
        of the task and x is the moment when it is completed.


Algorithm
        Aim: To maximise the profit.

        let,    task 1 is completed at x1 moment
                task 2 is completed at x2 moment
                ....

                ...
                task n is completed at xn moment

        Answer =    (d1 - x1) + (d2 - x2) + ..... + (dn - xn)
                    (d1 + d2 + ... + dn) - (x1 + x2 + ... + xn)

        Since, d1 + d2 + ..... + dn is constant, the solution can only
        be optimised by minimising the sum (x1 + x2 + .... + xn)

        Let the first duration is ________ and second duration is ---.
        Then x1 + x2 will be 8 + 11 = 19.

        Let the first duration is --- and second duration is --------.
        Then x1 + x2 will be 3 + 11 = 14.

        From the above observation we can say that, it is optimal to choose
        a Task with smaller duration first.
