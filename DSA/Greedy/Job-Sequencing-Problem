* Starting Time
* Ending Time
* Profit

Tell max-profit

Greedy Algorithm:
        The answer will have some starting Job.
        All the other Jobs in the ans will have their starting
        time grater then the ending time of first Job.

        So, it is better to sort the Jobs by their starting time so
        I can process them in some order.

        I can find the best profit which I will get by considering
        each Job as the starting Job.

        Now, the problem can be thought of as a dynamic problem.

        Sub-Problems:
                Given, a series jobs starting from index i.
                Tell me the max profit which I can get by doing those
                jobs such that no jobs collapse with each other.
        Guesses:
                Guesses will be made about the first Job.
                a) either i will do the ith job
                b) I do not do the ith job
        Expressions:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i+1], profit[i] + dp[x])
                Here, x is the index such that the starting point of the
                Jobs after that is greater than equal to the ending
                time of the ith job
        Answering the original problem:
                return dp[0]
