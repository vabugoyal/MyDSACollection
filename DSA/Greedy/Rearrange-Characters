Greedy Algorithm1:
        Find the frequency of each character.
        Sort the frequencies.
        Lets, say max freq count is x
        c c c c ...... c
        There are x - 1 gaps.

        The freq sum of rest of the elements should be at least
        than x-1.

        CODE:

            string s;
            cin >> s;
            vl ls(26, 0);
            for(auto c: s) {
                ls[c - 'a']++;
            }
            sortv(ls);
            ll sum = accumulate(all(ls), 0);
            if (sum - ls[25] >= ls[25]-1){
                pr(1)
            } else {
                pr(0)
            }
