PROBLEM : https://cses.fi/problemset/task/2162

Approach :
    We will have a next array where will store
    the next of each number. Now we have to take every second number.
    We will have a curr pointer initially pointed to
    1 then
    - change the next of 1 to next[2]
    - add next of 2 to the ans
    - go to next[next[2]]
    this will be done n times.

CODE:
        int n, k; cin >> n >> k;
        // store the next and store the kth
        vl next(n + 1);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            next[i] = i + 1 > n ? i + 1 - n : i + 1;
        }
        int curr = 1;
        vl ans;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            ans.push_back(next[curr]);
            next[curr] = next[next[curr]];
            curr = next[curr];
        }

        show(ans)
