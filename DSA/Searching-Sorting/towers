PROBLEM : https://cses.fi/problemset/result/3439154/

Approach :
        Lets say I have some towers already built.
        Now I want to put box of size ls[i] on them or create a new tower.
        If I find a tower which has its top
        box just bigger than the given box then I is
        better to place the box on that tower compared to
        all other towers.
        Now, starting a new tower with this box will not be beneficial
        because if I left that tower for some future box which was greater
        than or equal to the current box then why not start the new tower with
        that box. And smaller box is out ruled as it can
        be placed on top of the current box.
        Now, the only time we create a new tower is when there
        does not exists a tower whose top box is greater than the current tower.


CODE :

        int n; cin >> n;
        vl boxes(n); read(boxes)
        vl towerTops; towerTops.push_back(inf);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            auto j = std::upper_bound(towerTops.begin(), towerTops.end(), boxes[i]) - towerTops.begin();
            if (j == towerTops.size()){
                towerTops.push_back(boxes[i]);
            } else {
                towerTops[j] = boxes[i];
            }
        }

        pr(towerTops.size())
