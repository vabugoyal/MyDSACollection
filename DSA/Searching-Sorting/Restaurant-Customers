Problem : https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1619/

Approach :
        We can keep track of all the moments in a set.
        At any time we can check how many people are still in the
        Restaurant. When a person enters, that moment will be
        marked by +1 and departure of a customer will be marked by -1.

CODE :
        int n; cin >> n;
        set<ar<int, 2>> s;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int a, b; cin >> a >> b;
            s.insert({a, 1});
            s.insert({b + 1, -1});
        }
        int ans = 1, c = 0;
        for(auto a : s) {
            c += a[1];
            ans = max(ans, c);
        }

        cout << ans;
