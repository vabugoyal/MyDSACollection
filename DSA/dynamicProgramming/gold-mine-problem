STRUCTURE

Sub-Problems:
        given the miner in some column i and row j,
        tell me the max gold which he can get, given
        he can move -, /, \ to next row
Guesses:
        a) miner will go straight
        b) miner will move up-right
        c) miner will move down-right
Expressions:
        dp[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + max(dp[i][j+1], dp[i+1][j+1], dp[i-1][j+1])

        Base Cases
        dp[n][j] = 0 for all j
        dp[i][m] = 0 for all i
Answering the original problem:
        return max of dp[i][0] for all i in n.
