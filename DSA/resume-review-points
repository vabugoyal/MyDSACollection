Internships
[Trilogy Innovations]
The best thing about TI is, you are not told what to do
rather you allowed to build the roadmap and take control
of the wheel, and drive the project till the end.
I experimented a lot in trilogy innovations on the features
are built.

Since, the team size is small for a particular project
so the ownership of the task or feature is very high on
you. You have very less time to gain the learnings from
senior devs.

[Loop AI]
Loop AI was a san francisco based startup. It provided me a
complete startup exposure. Things were
shipped to production really fast there. You are expected to
do more in less time which even helped me in increasing my
productivity.

Everybody is so involved in their tasks that you hardly get
time to interact with you seniors besides the stand up calls.
It taught me a lot about independent working and figuring out most
of the things on my own.
