COVER LETTER

Hi,
I am writing to express my strong interest in the Software Engineer Position at CGI. As a highly motivated and technically skilled individual, I am excited about the prospect of contributing my skills and enthusiasm to your team.

Currently pursuing a B.Tech. in Computer Science from the Indian Institute of Technology, Mandi, I have developed a solid foundation in computer science principles and gained practical experience through internships. During my time at Loop AI as a Summer Intern, I played a key role in building a notification service and integrating accounting providers, resulting in improved customer engagement and streamlined accounting processes. My Winter Internship at Trilogy Innovations allowed me to collaborate with international teams, enhance CI/CD pipelines, and contribute to project management improvements.

My projects, such as the Gaussian Eliminator web application and the Graph Visualiser, showcase my ability to design and implement practical solutions using technologies like Django, JavaScript, and Python. These experiences have not only honed my technical skills but also developed my problem-solving abilities and teamwork.

In addition to my technical expertise, I have excelled in competitive programming, achieving global ranks on platforms like Codeforces and CodeChef. I am a motivated self-learner and a dedicated team player, as demonstrated by my involvement in the Programming Club at IIT Mandi and my role as a Problem Setter for the Intra College Competitive Programming Contest.

Enclosed is my resume, which provides more detailed information about my education, experience, and â‰¤technical skills. I am confident that my background aligns well with the requirements of the Software Developer role and that my passion for innovation and continuous learning would make me a valuable addition to your team.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how my skills and experiences match your needs. Please feel free to contact me at +919812276214 or vaibhavgoyaliit@gmail.com to schedule a conversation.

Sincerely,
Vaibhav Goyal

In my most recent internship at Trilogy Innovations, I significantly reduced project completion time from 76 to 68 days by implementing a streamlined template-based development and deployment process, improving CI/CD, and enabling automatic updates via pull requests. I also simplified user management by enabling one-click addition to all project resources. Additionally, I created an admin dashboard for monitoring AWS deployments and maintained detailed documentation of tasks and potential issues.

During my internship at Loop AI, I developed a versatile notification service supporting SMS and email across multiple channels while adhering to the open-closed principle. I facilitated the onboarding process for the operations team through an admin portal, displaying onboarding status and key information.

what makes someone a good software engineer?
Act as a blackbox to the manager and able to provide the best possible technical solution to the problem. Also, able to implement that in an organised way. Putting realistic deadlines and achieve them.




Hi, I am senior at IIT Mandi from Computer Science Department. I have done two SDE internships at Codenation and Loop AI. I heard interviews are happening for SDE internship at Amazon. It would really helpful if you can share my resume with your manager or HR.
Thanks



Hi, I am Vaibhav. I done two fullstack software development internships where I have worked with django, flask, react, gcp, aws, git, etc. I  am very adaptable to the new technologies.
