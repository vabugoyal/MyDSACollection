Two Pointers:
use two pointers l and r
iterate over the columns using these two pointers
two pointers is valid because
if in a[][l ... r] does not contain a square with sum >= k
then a[][l1 ... r1] will also not contain a square with sum >= k

// go to every column then binary search over the size of the square
