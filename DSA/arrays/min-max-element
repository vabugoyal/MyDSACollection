Approach1:
    Idea is to first compare the two
    elements of the array and then comparing
    the corresponding elements with the
    corresponding curr_min and curr_max

Tournament Method:
    Find the min-max of the left subarray
    and right subarray and then use that
    to find the ans for curr subarray.
