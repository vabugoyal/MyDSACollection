Approach:
    Initially have a TRIE which will support the following
    operations:
    a) insert
    b) delete
    c) find max XOR
    Now, do a dfs on the tree.
    Add the parent node while going to
    its child and the remove it when dfs
    if completed for that subtree.
    On the way find the max XOR val.
