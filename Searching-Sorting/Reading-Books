PROBLEM : https://cses.fi/problemset/task/1631

Approach :
        Observation :
            The first person has to read all the books.
            The second person has to read all the books.
            So, the ans is at least sum of all times.
            Lets say first person starts reading the books in sorted
            order. Second, person reads in reverse order.
            Now, the moment the first person reads the max time
            book the shortest time book would have been freed up.
            So, he will read the books in reverse sorted order.

            But what if the max time book takes more time then
            reading the first n - 1 books in the sorted order, then
            first person has to wait till the first book is freed up.
            Then, he will read that book. Ans in this case would be
            2 * max time.

            Final ans = max(all sum, 2 * max time)

CODE :
        int n; cin >> n;
        vl ls(n); read(ls)
        int ans = max(accumulate(all(ls), 0LL), 2 * *max_element(all(ls)));
        pr(ans)
